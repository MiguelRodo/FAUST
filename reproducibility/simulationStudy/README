This directory contains R functions and shell scripts needed to reproduce the simulation results
reported in the supplement of the FAUST manuscript.

To reproduce the simulations, the R script "01_runSimulation.R" must be run with 36 different parameter settings.

The shell script "startAllSims.sh" loops over the parameter settings, and calls the shell script "launchSim.sh" with
all combinations of parameters reported in the supplement.

The shell script "launchSim.sh" is a shell script that presumes the slurm workload manager is available to launch jobs.
If slurm is available, and the requested resources are also avialable, you can modify the shell script parameters in
order to run the simulation in your local environment.

Otherwise, parameters can directly be set in the R script "01_runSimulation.R".
The file "01_runSimulation.R" imports the file "functionsForSimulation.R", in order to simulate data.


To run fewer than the 50 reported simulation iterations, the variable "simIter" on line 150 should be set to
the desired number of simulation iterations.

Within each simulation, if you wish to run fewer than the 50 reported response simulations, modify the
variables "modelIter" and "NITERS" on line 458.

Once simulations have completed, the script "02_parseResults.R" can be used to produce the repoting plots for all
available output.
